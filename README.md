# Orbital Sim
This is a simple satellite orbital simulation software I am working on to help aid some of my work in Husky Satellite Lab on the ADC susbsystem.
## Current Features
Currently, the simulations model translational and rotational dynamics, as well as Earth's magnetic field. 
## Features coming soon
I plan on revamping the integration model. It is currently too slow with rotational dynamics, and I want to play around with the tolerances and time step settings. I also will keep updating the simulation with more and more modeling functionality. The next thing I have coming up is sensors and noise, and then adding in a magnetorquer model. Eventually, reaction wheels too.
## How to use/run
Eventually I'll have a write up here explaining what values you can play around with to test out different things. We'll see when that happens. For now, you can just run main :-).
## Acknowledgements
This simulation is partially adapted/based off of Dr. Carlos Montalvo ADCS seminar series. I also used his [book](https://github.com/cmontalvo251/LaTeX/blob/master/Aerospace_Mechanics/aerospace_mechanics.pdf) as a refrence throughout, especially on some of the equations and conversions I wasn't too familar with.
